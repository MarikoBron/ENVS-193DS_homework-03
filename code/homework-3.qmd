#Problem 1: Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I am adding together five quantitative variables to calculate my perceived daily stress level, including the number of classes skipped, number of assignments/tasks due, number of assignments/tasks done, number of plans cancelled, and number of hours slept. I am comparing this daily self-imposed stress value to my daily screentime to look for correlations between the two values because sometimes I feel like high perceived stress pushes me to use my phone more to avoid tasks.

## b. Visualization

```{creating a visualization}

screentime_clean <- screentime |> 
  clean_names()


```
