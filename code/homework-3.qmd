I am adding together five quantitative variables to calculate my perceived daily stress level, including the number of classes skipped, number of assignments/tasks due, number of assignments/tasks done, number of plans cancelled, and number of hours slept. I am comparing this daily self-imposed stress value to my daily screentime to look for correlations between the two values because sometimes I feel like high perceived stress pushes me to use my phone more to avoid tasks.

## b. Visualization
