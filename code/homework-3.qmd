#Problem 1: Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I am adding together five quantitative variables to calculate my perceived daily stress level, including the number of classes skipped, number of assignments/tasks due, number of assignments/tasks done, number of plans cancelled, and number of hours slept. I am comparing this daily self-imposed stress value to my daily screentime to look for correlations between the two values because sometimes I feel like high perceived stress pushes me to use my phone more to avoid tasks.

## b. Visualization

```{creating a visualization}

screentime_clean <- screentime |>  #create object screentime_clean
  clean_names() |> 
  select(number_classes_skipped, number_tasks_due, number_hw_assn_done_1, number_plans_cancelled, x8_number_hrs_slept, stress_value, screen_time_h) |> 
  rename( 
        `classes skipped` = number_classes_skipped ,
        `tasks due` = number_tasks_due,
        `assignments completed` = number_hw_assn_done_1,
        `plans cancelled` = number_plans_cancelled,
        `hours slept` = x8_number_hrs_slept,
        `stress value` = stress_value,
        `screentime(h)` = screen_time_h #renaming all of my columns
         )
hcl_palettes() #downloading cute color palette just in case I need it
ggplot(screentime_clean, 
       aes(
         x = `stress value`,
         y = `screentime(h)`,
         color = `tasks due`
       )) + #create scatterplot to look for correlation between stress value and screentime (there is lowkey none)
  geom_point(
    color = "darkslateblue",
    fill = "mediumpurple", 
    shape = 23,
    alpha = 0.6,
    size = 4,
    stroke = 1.5 #make scatterplot cute
  ) +
  
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Screentime and Perceived Stress Value",
    x = "Stress Value",
    y = "Screentime (h)",
    color = "Tasks Due"
  )
